# CommandShell

Command line tool support.

Version 2.0 is based on Apple's new swift-argument-parser library.

This package just contains a few utilities providing common / standard functionality for any command line tool.

Version 1.0 was a bespoke system with a completely different API. Commands using this version will require porting to use swift-argument-parser instead.
